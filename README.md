# Machine Learning by Sumat

Welcome to my Machine Learning repository! This repository showcases various machine learning projects that I've developed as part of my learning journey.

## Projects

In this repository, you will find links to my projects, including:
1) Supervised Learning
Project 1 - Polynomial fit with regularisation - link(https://github.com/opsdevsumat047/MachineLearningbyme/blob/main/applestockpredictionusingregularisation.py)
Project 2 - Plynomial fit purely through sklearn (more accurate) - link(https://github.com/opsdevsumat047/MachineLearningbyme/blob/main/applesotckspredictionfromsklearn.py)


(I will Continue adding projects as needed)
